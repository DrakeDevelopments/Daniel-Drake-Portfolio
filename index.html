                <p>I am a maths graduate based in the UK. Currently I am polishing my skills in front end web development (HTML and CSS) and I have also prototyped a game using C# and the Unity engine.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I've been prototyping a 2D action adventure game using the Unity engine along with C#.</p>
                <p>This has allowed me to explore a variety of different creative endeavours including music, art, animation, and coding. The link below will take you to a page where I discuss how I implemented features within my game as well as progress updates.</p>

                <p>I've made my way through freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Course Certification" and I'm looking to complete the remaining courses in the coming weeks. As I make my way through these courses I'll have a lot more projects linked in this section as well as more functionality.</p>
                <p>This website is responsive, try resizing the window to see what happens on phones/smaller screens. Check back regularly, over the coming weeks there will be a lot more to see!</p>
