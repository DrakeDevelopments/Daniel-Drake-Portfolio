                </div>

                <p>I've been developing a game using the Unity Engine and C# for the last year or so. Unfortunately I haven't been able to invest as much time into this project as I would have liked (work or DIY projects take up most of my time), however most of the basics are set up!</p>

                    <h2>The Aim of the Game</h2>
                </div>

                <p>I don't want to give away too much of the story, but I can give away what the aim are... mechanically.</p>
                <p>It's a 2D action adventure game, with some souls-like mechanics. You start off in a tutorial area, where you learn to run, jump, and attack. Defeating ememies rewards you with a currency that's used to purchase level-ups. There's also abilities that your can purchase to equip onto your character to give them additional powers. The equipable abilities are currently in development, however, the leveling up system is functional.</p>
                <p>Upon completing the tutorial you gain access to a "home" area, where you can shop, level up, buy a house, and more! There are multiple areas each with their own themes, and bosses. All previous bosses must be defeated in order to challenge the final boss. At which point the end-credits roll and you can continue exploring the map and completing side quests.</p>

                <p>I'd like to add a demo or gallery here to show the features I've created so far, as well as some detailed explanations on how I did it. Hopefully this will come soon, check back weekly, as this site is constantly being updated!</p>
